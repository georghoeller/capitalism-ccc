The following is a definition of:  PRODUCER PRICE INDEX REVISION-CURRENT SERIES (PC)

Survey Description:  The Producer Price Index Revision-Current Series indexes reflect
price movements for the net output of producers organized according to the 
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The PC dataset is compatible 
with a wide assortment of NAICS-based economic time series including:  productivity, 
production, employment, wages, and earnings.  

The PPI universe consists of the output of all industries in the goods-producing 
sectors of the U.S. economy- mining, manufacturing, agriculture, fishing, and 
forestry- as well as natural gas, electricity, construction, and goods competitive
with those made in the producing sectors, such as waste and scrap materials. In
addition, as of January 2011, the PPI program covered more than three-quarters of the
service sector's output, publishing data for selected industries in the following 
industry sectors: wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing;
information; finance and insurance; real estate brokering, rental, and leasing; 
professional, scientific, and technical services; administrative, support, and waste 
management services; health care and social assistance; and accommodation.

To the extent possible, prices used in constructing the indexes are the 
actual revenue or net transaction prices producers receive for sales of
their outputs.  Scientific (probability) sampling techniques are 
used to select reporting establishments, products, and transactions for all
types and volumes of output (not just volume-sellers).

Coverage includes roughly 500 mining and manufacturing industries and approximately 
150 services industries.  The PPI is meant to measure changes in prices
received by domestic producers, import products are not priced in the survey. 

BLS collects over 100,000 price quotations each month covering over 600 industries
and over 6,000 products and product categories.

Frequency of Observations:  Monthly in most cases.

Annual Averages:  Annual averages are available.

Data Characteristics:  All data through June 2021 are stored with one decimal 
place. Data after June 2021 are stored with 3 decimal places.

Updating Schedule:  Updates are usually available on or before the 15th
day of the month following a given reference month.  For example, January 
index data are usually made available on or before the 15th of February.

Effective with the release of the January 2004 data, the PPI program converted 
from the SIC System to the NAIC System.  Also effective with this release, the PPI's 
PD database contains the complete history of published SIC-based time series.

With the release of indexes for July 2004, PPI produced a separate dataset
for discontinued NAICS-based indexes.

The term time series, and the series file, data file, and mapping file definitions
and relationships are detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)
